[["index.html", "ACTS 135 - Mathematical Statistics 1 About This Course", " ACTS 135 - Mathematical Statistics Linfeng Zhang 2022-12-12 1 About This Course This course is developed based on Mathematical Statistics, 7th Edition (2008), Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer. This course is an introduction to the basic principles of mathematical statistics, and is a companion course to ACTS 131, which focused more on probability. In fact, we use the same textbook here (Chapters 8-10, 14-15) as was used for ACTS 131 (Chapters 1-7). This course provides credit for the VEE (Validation by Educational Experience) requirement of the SOA for Mathematical Statistics, provided a student receives a grade of B- or above. If on the CAS track, it relates to the Statistics portion of Exam MAS-I. The course is divided into four chunks as follows: Chapter 8: Point and Interval Estimation of Model Parameters Chapter 9: Properties of Estimators and Methods of Estimation Chapter 10: Hypothesis Testing for Mean, Variance, and Proportion Parameters Chapters 14-15: Selected Tests for Categorical Data and Nonparametric Statistics "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
